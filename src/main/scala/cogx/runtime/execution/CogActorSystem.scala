/** Actor system for Cog which implements the computation.
  *
  * The typical Akka actor scenario uses static configuration in an
  * `application.conf` file which is not a good match for Cog.
  * So we need to do additional magic here to make Akka do what we
  * need. In particular, the `application.conf` file used by Akka is too rigid
  * for our needs, so we do all configuration programmatically within this
  * file.

    *
    * Some other attempts at creating a one-actor-per-thread dispatcher
    * didn't work.  Playing with the parameters of the default dispatcher
    * created a system with the correct number of threads, but the application
    * hung around for keep-alive-time before terminating.  Setting the
    * keep-alive-time to a low value resulted in threads that terminated
    * when their actor was idle for longer than that time.
    *
    * The solution that worked stayed close to the recommendations of the
    * "Dispatchers" section of the Akka documentation (section 5.9).  However,
    * the suggestion to set allow-core-timeout = off seemed ineffective, and
    * the threads timed out after the default 60 seconds of idleness.  Setting
    * keep-alive-time to a large value corrected this.
    *
    * The UnboundedDequeueBasedMailbox is a requirement to use the Stash trait.
    * Stash is useful when one wants an Actor to "become" another temporarily,
    * without losing the messages that belong to the previous context.  The
    * GPUSupervisor class used stash at one time, but no longer does so.
